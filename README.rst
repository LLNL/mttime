MTtime
======

MTtime (Time Domain Moment Tensor Inversion in Python) is a python package developed for time domain inversion of complete seismic waveform data
to obtain the seismic moment tensor. It supports deviatoric and full moment tensor inversions,
and 1-D and 3-D basis Green's functions.

Requirements
------------
The package was developed on python 3.7 and 3.8, and is running and tested on Mac OSX.

* ObsPy 1.0.* and its dependencies
* pandas 1.0.*
* cartopy (for plotting maps)

Installation
------------

* Create a Python environment
* Install ObsPy and pandas
* Make sure you have `cloned the repository <https://github.com/LLNL/mttime>`_
* Install mttime

I recommend installing Python via `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_
or `Anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>`_. Choose Miniconda for a lower footprint.
Then follow the instructions on their sites to install
`ObsPy <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki/Installation-via-Anaconda>`_
and `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html>`_
for your given platform.

Download mttime and install it from source. If you installed Python via conda make sure you activate
the environment where ObsPy and pandas are installed.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Activate environment
   conda activate your_environment

   # Build and install mttime
   git clone https://github.com/LLNL/mttime
   cd mttime
   python setup.py install


Finally, if you want to run the tutorials you will need to install `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter.org/install>`_.

Usage
-----

Executing the package from command line will launch the inversion,
save and plot the result to file:

.. code-block:: bash

   mttime-run mtinv.in

The equivalent in the Python console:

.. code-block:: python

   import mttime
   config = mttime.Configure(path_to_file="mtinv.in")
   mt = mttime.Inversion(config=config)
   mt.invert()
   mt.write()
